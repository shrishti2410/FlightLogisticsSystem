DSA PROJECT :
AirEase: A Flight Logistics System

Problem Statement :
AirEase aims to simplify the airline management process by providing a user-friendly system for both travelers and administrators.
The system will allow users to search for and book flights based on minimum cost or shortest travel distance between cities,
facilitating quick decision-making for travelers.
Admins can access a dedicated interface to manage flight bookings, reschedule flights based on real-time weather data,
and ensure a seamless experience for users despite weather disruptions.
This dual-interface system will be built to handle the complexities of real-world logistics with efficient data structures and algorithms.
